##  MTG-Jamendo dataset

To download and unpack the dataset, I used the script provided by its authors [download.py](src%2Fdata%2Fmtg_jamendo_dataset%2Fscripts%2Fdownload%2Fdownload.py) with a few modifications to fit my case -  the altered version can be found here: [download.py](src%2Fdata%2FMTG_Jamendo%2Fdownload.py).
